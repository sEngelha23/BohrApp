# DrillApplication

In this project, my team and I have continued working on the foundational app, focusing on enhancing its functionality. 
One of the major updates includes the addition of an application that predicts the material involved in drilling processes and visually represents the data. 
In parallel, we expanded the design of the app to improve user experience and incorporated a new algorithm that processes and integrates both existing and live data into the system. 
This allows for more accurate predictions and real-time insights, further enhancing the app's capabilities.
